# PHPStorm Settings

## Configuration
To use these settings within your PHPStorm:

1. In the Settings/Preferences dialog (âŒ˜,), click Settings Repository under Tools.
2. Click ![add](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/img/idea/2018.1/add.png) and add the URL of the GitHub repository that contains the settings you want to share.

These settings will be overlayed on top of your settings, and will only affect global configuration


## What if the settings need to be changed?
If you find the settings are doing something weird, broken or just could be improved, create a new Jira under the [Devops](https://integralcs.atlassian.net/projects/DEVOPS) project
